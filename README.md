# PHP-Fundamentals

## Why PHP?

PHP is the most popular of all scripting languages, and powers all Drupal and Wordpress sites, as well as the majority of Facebook. It's one of the simplest programming languages to learn, and has a number of popular frameworks, such as Symfony and Laravel built on top if it.

## Key takeaways from the workshop

The exercises will guide you, step-by-step, through the development of a simple login system. After the workshop, you will understand the basic flow of a web page request, and how PHP handles it. You'll also gain a brief understanding of the security issues at stake in web systems in general, and an overview of the remedies available in PHP. This workshop is suitable for those with some programming experience.

## Pre-requisites

Attendees will need to bring along their own laptop, running either latest version of PHP and a Git client, or the latest version of VirtualBox. We will have USB sticks at the workshop containing sample code and virtual machines. Please turn up early if you need assistance getting your development environment up and running.
